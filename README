Overview
--------
This script is intended to take an MP3 containing many songs and cut it into a series of MP3 files, each containing one song.  The script also accepts a linebreak-separated list of song titles which determines into how many files the original MP3 file should be divided.

General Configuration
---------------------
- Set path_of_listing so it points to a txt file where the linebreak-separated list of song names is located.
- Set path_of_playlist so it points to the MP3 file to be split.

Configuration for Windows
-------------------------
Set path_of_mpg123 so it points to the path of mpg123 ("lib/mpg123/Win64/mpg123.exe" for Win64, for example.)

Configuration for Mac
---------------------
- Run the mpg123 install file (lib/mpg123/Mac10.8/mpg123-1.15.3-0.pkg), or get one more approrpiate for your version of Mac at "http://rudix.org/packages/mpg123.html"
	- It might be necessary to follow the following steps if you receive the following message: "App can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
		- Go to System Preferences... > Security & Privacy and there should be a button saying Open Anyway, under the General tab.

Current progress
----------------
- Script converts original MP3 file into WAV file.
- Script reads list of song titles.
- Script determines locations that most likely correspond to the silences between songs.
- Script outputs these locations, along with other diagnostic information into a directory called "diag".

Next Steps
----------
- Improve script's ability to correctly find the boundaries between songs.
- Perform the split and assign names.
- Create GUI.

Getting started
---------------
- Ensure numpy is installed.
- Ensure the files required to run mpg123 on your system's operating system and/or architecture is available in lib/mpg123.  If not, download them and place them in an appropriately named directory.  Set the variable path_of_mpg123 in PlaylistSplit.py so that it points to the required executable.  
- Ensure the variable path_of_listing points to a text file containing a list of song names.
- Ensure the variable path_of_playlist points to an mp3 file.
- If you want to quickly test the script, copy the directory test_assets/inputs to the root.
